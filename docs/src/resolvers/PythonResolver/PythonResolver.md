## Python Resolver

Python based implemention of the file resolver:
- It implements the features listed in the [resolvers overview section](../overview.md).
- This resolver has feature parity to the file resolver, but the implementation is slightly different. The goal of this resolver is to enable easier RnD by running all resolver and resolver context related methods in Python. It can be used to quickly inspect resolve calls and to setup prototypes of resolvers that can then later be re-written in C++ as it is easier to code database related pipelines in Python.
- Running in Python does not allow proper multithreading due to Python's [Global Interpreter Lock](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock), so this resolver should not be used in (large scale) productions.
